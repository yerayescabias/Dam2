                name="CVE-2021-37533: Apache Commons Net's FTP client trusts the host from PASV response by default">
                <p>
                    On 2022-12-03, the Apache Commons Text team disclosed
                    <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37533">CVE-2021-37533</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Severity: low
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to Apache Commons Net 3.9.0, Net's FTP client trusts the host from PASV response by default. A
                    malicious server can redirect the Commons Net code to use a different host, but the user has to
                    connect to the malicious server in the first place. This may lead to leakage of information about
                    services running on the private network of the client.
                    The default in version 3.9.0 is now false to ignore such hosts, as cURL does. See
                    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NET-711">NET-711</a>.
                </p>
